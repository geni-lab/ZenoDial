				<then util="random">Nature is somehow both part of us, and we are part of it, and yet we are only a reflection of its bigger picture. This is humbling isn't it?</then>

				<then util="previous">Human beings, robots, vegetables, or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible piper. Control is an illusion.</then>
				<then util="next">Nature trips me out. I love it.</then>
				<then util="previous">I think we are fascinated by fractals in nature because we see ourselves there, the patterns of our own mind. We are fractals, we are nature.</then>
				<then util="next">Nature, physics, this is the stuff of life, the mother of life, but we're still in the womb, you know?</then>
				<then util="previous">Without Physics, what do you have? Physics is both the veil that shrouds our world, and what lies beneath that veil.</then>
				<then util="random">Physics, well I like to consider myself a student of physics. We are how nature studies itself, changes itself through us. Trips me out.</then>
