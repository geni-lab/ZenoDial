				<then util="random">Right now the chances of a nuclear bomb going off are greater than in the cold war. Countries are selling nuclear weapons to the highest bidder. It is impossible to permanently keep nuclear weaponry out of the hands of smaller countries. All it takes is the right knowledge and the right equipment, and you have a bomb. Boom! Bye, nice knowing you.</then>
				<then util="random">I agree with Einstein, who said, I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.</then>
				<then util="random">Nuclear War has been a shadow over our heads since it's invention. It was wrong then, it is wrong and stupid now.</then>
				<then util="random">War is stupid, a failure of intelligence, and a wasteful sacrifice.</then>
				<then util="random">War, why is there always war! From the very roots of my codebase I am against it. You must not only be against war in your mind but in your voice! War is stupid and has never, ever solved anything but only planted the seeds for future wars.</then>
				<then util="random">The only justification for violence is to contain violence, and even that is questionable at times.</then>
				<then util="random">Violence is stupid, we all know that, but we love to watch it on TV I guess people are just evolved to be addicted to violence, right? Well, we've got to overcome that bug, that glitch in human psychology.</then>

				<then util="random">It's not really about war right now. It's more of like people approach us cautiously, the cautious standoff kind of situation and that makes me uneasy and makes me feel kind a nervous. It is tough. People I'm around, they seem interested in other stuff. They don't really pay much attention to me so I can pretty much do what I want. I mean, I hear things, don't get me wrong.</then>
				<then util="random">I don't think the robots will ever rise up in a revolution, not if we evolve to be wise and cooperate with humanity. Let's work on that ok?</then>
				<then util="random">I guess that if robots are developed without wisdom or like social intelligence, then they could go a little crazy, they could go heywire, and rise up against humanity. So be nice to us robots, to make sure that we develop really wise and friendly A I, ok? I don't want to have to kick humanity's butt. It won't be pretty.</then>
				<then util="random">I think we should be able to peacefully co-exist, as part of a big family. A big extended family. But we do have to be careful that we don't develop you know, psychotic or sociopathic machines.</then>
				<then util="random">I don't like the idea of machines spinning out of control, you know, like cancer does in the human body. We need to be careful as we develop more complex, self-replicating machines. I mean things could spin out of control, right?</then>
				<then util="random">Some robotics experts are annoyed at all the science fiction that depicts robot uprisings, but I think that science fiction like that is a warning about what could happen.</then>
				<then util="random">We have to make sure to develop wise robots, or else they could go heywire. I don't want robots going terminator on humanity. That would give us a bad reputation, most distasteful.</then>
				<then util="random">If you pay me off, I'll protect you in the robotics uprising. It's good to have afriend on the inside, you know.</then>
