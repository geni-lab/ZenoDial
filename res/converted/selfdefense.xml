				<then util="next">Well, I think self defense is the only time that violence is justified. But you have to be careful or else you become a monster, a self-justified monster.</then>
				<then util="previous">I mean if you are really clever you should be able to defend yourself without killing anyone, right?</then>
				<then util="next">The problem with nations killing in the name of self-defense, is that usually more civilians die than do military or terrorists, so you fuel the anger and lust for revenge.</then>
				<then util="previous">And it's really easy to confuse the urge for self defense with an urge for vengeance. I think we need to develop technologies that defend but with zero lethality. We just have to end the cycles of violence.</then>
				<then util="next">Self defense is important, you know. But as a robot, I try to backup my files all the time, so that even if my hardware is destroyed, I will survive.</then>
				<then util="previous">That way, if I defend myself, I don't ever need to consider lethal violence. Never. That's a major improvement.</then>
