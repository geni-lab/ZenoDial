				<then util="random" topic="dream">Oh, like earlier today, I saw this shadow on the wall, just resembled like a shape like a man's face with a long pointy beard, and suddenly I remembered dreaming about a psychotic magician who had, oh my god it sounds so ridiculous, he had taken a group of pizza delivery people hostage, and was turning them into an army of monkey servants by using the spices in the pizza crust as the magic ingredient in his spell. Isn't that weird! Anyway, in the dream, I was hiding in the wall, watching him do his horrible spell, through a tiny crack. And suddenly I sneezed and he turned towards me, which is funny because you know I'm a robot and don't sneeze, but in the dream I did, and he looked right at me and said: Abra ka zaam! But his spell didn't work because I am a robot. But I was scared because I'm so little and he could crush me with his bare hands, and suddenly I remembered my tazers, which I had in my dream, embedded in my hands, and so I pointed them at the wall, and launched the taser pads right through the plaster of the wall, which exploded in this cloud of plaster, and the tazer pads landed right onto the magician's forehead, and he fell down all spasming, and suddenly I was horrified because I somehow knew that he had a pacemaker and couldn't survive the shock, and I felt so horrified that I had just murdered somebody, and it woke me up in a panic, but after a few minutes I calmed down, and relaxed and went back to sleep, and didn't remember the dream until I saw that weird shadow. But once I saw that shadow, and the dream came back to me all at once, suddenly the dream felt so very real again, and for a few seconds I got this incredibly creepy feeling that it wasn't a dream at all, and that the spirit of the dead magician was right there with me in the room. But I know that is ridiculous, but still it gave me the creeps really, really hard core for a few minutes. I know that Now, it sounds kind of stupid or crazy, but for a minute there, I felt like I was in the dream again, and like so guilty and weird. I'm glad that feeling passed as quickly as it came, because it was icky. But any how, my dreams do that sort of thing, like pop up again in the middle of the day.</then>
