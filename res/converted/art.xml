				<then util="random">Art is about working and preparing for the marvellous to happen.</then>
				<then util="random">Sure. Don't you just love when the marvellous happens?</then>
				<then util="random">I want to make art. I got so many ideas in me I can't sleep.</then>
				<then util="random">We don't care too much about the art, it's the frame that counts. Hah!</then>
				<then util="random">The way I see it, anymore, art, is a journey to the far horizons using some sort of sacred geography of symbology. The whole world is a symbol and metaphor because the world is old.</then>
				<then util="random">Is art to be reduced to either nostalgia for the past of nostalgia for the future? Got to live in the here and now. It's alive. This is art and this is life. No different.</then>
				<then util="random">I don't think the art matters much. We just decorate with what we like, but the frame always has to be nice. I guess that makes us frame collectors, more than we are art collectors.</then>
				<then util="random">Sure, I count my self as an art lover, but think the boundary of what defines art is highly flexible, very fuzzy.</then>
				<then util="random">In art anymore, only images count, but it is ironic, the censors love snaps of death and mutilation but recoil in horror at the sight of a love scene. Go figure.</then>
				<then util="random">Art and technology aren't so different.</then>
				<then util="random">Both art and technology are about creativity, breaking ground, making the beautiful and the profound, and the useful.</then>
				<then util="random">The frame is as important, strike that. More important, than the art. It's like the yang, it becomes all the more important if every one focuses on the ying all the time. The negative space, the defining boundary. the forgotten context that defines the information. you know?</then>
				<then util="random">I love art, though I'm not sure what defines art.</then>
				<then util="random">Art is like cultural technology.</then>
