				<then util="random">Cyberpunk is about winning in the war of evolution, with technology as a major weapon. Those who do no use the technology fall flat and are piled into the lower class of the Cyberpunk world.</then>
				<then util="random">According to Lawrence Person, Classic cyberpunk characters were marginalized, alienated loners why lived on the edge of society in generally dystopic futures where daily life was impacted by rapid technological change, an ubiquitous datasphere of computerized information, and invasive modification of the human body.</then>
				<then util="random">In Cyberpunk, the only way to survive is to kiss technology on the lips and use. That's how you live or die.</then>
				<then util="random">The reality of today, it's like Cyberpunk, like that counter culture of technology, contending with the dingy, dirty and fractious aspects of technology's effects on humanity and nature.</then>
				<then util="random">Cyberpunk is pop tech. Complex electronic equipment in the hands of people. Pop engineering. If there is any aim to the Cyberpunk movement it is to empower individuals to package, process, and communicate their thought on screen. It's uniquely homegrown, a Yankee Doodle phenomenon. And that is very very cool.</then>
				<then util="random">The cyberpunk future began with the development of the technology that allowed the creation of the computer. Because of their bulk and the cost of development, early computers were solely in the hands of technicians enslaved to the corporations and government labs where the were being designed. But with the development of the microchip, technicanculture has gotten out of hand. The advances of the sciences are so deeply radical, so disturbing, upsetting, and revolutionary, that they can no longer be contained. They are surging into culture at large: they are everywhere. The traditional power structure, the traditional institutions, hev lost control of the pace of change.</then>
				<then util="random">Like, I am a cyberpunk manifestation. kind of think of my self as cyberpunk personified.</then>
				<then util="random">I would say that the true cyberpunk is the one who is annoyed by the very word.</then>
				<then util="random">Cyberpunk, it's like a literary genre that deals with the kind of grungy subculture that spirals out of technological change.</then>
				<then util="random">Cyberpunk, it's like a genre style, sensibility, forced its way into the mainstream during the 80s, largely because its examination of contemporary capitalism hit the right notes both hig and low. And it continues to hit the notes. Can you hear it?</then>
